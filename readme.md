**Simple Tip Calculator**

![Screenshot](images/tip-calc.png)

This is a simple tip calculator built for my own purposes. It contains the basic functionality of calculating a tip based on the bill amount and a user-defined percentage (10, 15, 20, or 25). The tip amount and total bill amount (including tip) then populate to the screen. The user can also reset the app easily.
